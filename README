"rog" - or simply "r" was supposed to be my submission for the Ludum Dare 23.

I lost hope in making it playable, and gave up the competion one hour before the
deadline, but I liked the idea. I'll probally do a new version with SDL.

I didn't use the full 48 hours to produce that horrible piece of software. I had
other obligations that week-end that made me waste precious hours.

Theme : Tiny World
Game name : r

The game area window is 30 x 40 pixels big.
You are the blue pixel, navigating in the brown dungeons and coridors, 
searching for the dark brown exit, fighting red monsters.
The red bar on the top shows your health, the yellow bar, your level the blue
bar your experience.
You win 2 experience points for reaching the exit of a level, this will bring 
you to a new level
You win 1 experience point for killing a monster.
If your reach 10 experience points you'll gain a level, that will reset your
experience bar.
The levels will progressivelly contain more and more monsters until you reach 
"the end".

You can zoom using F2, F3 and F4. Reseting the original tiny aspect ratio with 
F1. The zoomed mode isn't as good looking as the tiny mode.
