"rog" - or simply "r" was supposed to be my submission for the Ludum Dare 23.

I lost hope to make it playable, and gave up the competion one hour before the
deadline, but I liked the idea. I'll probally do a new version with SDL.

I didn't use the full 48 hours to produce that horrible piece of software. I had
other obligations that week-end that made me waste precious hours and focus on 
the project.

Theme : Tiny World
Game name : r

The game area window is 30 x 40 pixels big.
You are the blue pixel, navigating int the brown dungeons and coridors, 
searching for the dark brow exit, fighting red monsters.
The red bar on the top shows your health, the yellow bar, your level, the blue
bar, your experience.
You win 2 experience points for reaching the exit of a level, this will bring 
you to a new level
You win 1 experience point for killing a monster.
If your reach 10 experience points you'll gain a level, that will reset your
experience bar.
The levels will progressivelly contain more and more monsters until you reach 
"the end".
